# Changelog

Notable changes to corral. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions are [semantic](https://semver.org/), and pre-1.0 means the CLI surface can
still move between minor versions.

Entries describe what changed for someone *using* the tool. For the full commit
history of any release, `git log v0.3.4..v0.3.5`.

## [v0.3.6] — 2026-08-12

### Added
- **`corral doctor`** — check the environment before paying for a run. It verifies
  that the sandbox starts, that your test command's toolchain is reachable *inside*
  the sandbox, that a credential exists for every model you plan to route to, and
  that the file you named has a test corral can pair with. Every check is free — no
  model is called — and they run in the order an audit would hit them, so the first
  `FAIL` is the first thing to fix. Exits non-zero if any check failed.
- **Findings served to a coding agent over MCP**, and the *reason* a verdict was
  reached is now recorded alongside the verdict, so an agent can act on a gap
  instead of just being told a number. The findings corpus also works with no brain
  running.
- **The verdict names a single-vendor herd** — a run where every role resolved to
  one vendor now says so in the record, rather than leaving decorrelation to be
  inferred.

### Fixed
- **The jail can see toolchains installed outside `/usr`** (#101). Compilers and
  runtimes from snap, asdf, nvm, rustup, pyenv and Homebrew were on the host's
  `PATH` but invisible inside the sandbox, which surfaced only as an undiagnostic
  baseline failure.
- **CI hands back the test that proves the gap** (#101 sibling). A proven gap was
  reported without the authored test that proved it, leaving nothing to act on.

### Changed
- Documentation corrects a claim the audit path never supported, and adds the
  fourth participant to the description of the herd.

## [v0.3.5] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- The findings corpus works without a brain — no server required to read it.

### Changed
- `verify` now says plainly that **v0.3.3 and earlier accept an edited record**.
  If you are relying on tamper-evidence, upgrade.

## [v0.3.4] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- Twelve verifiable records published — and the hole that publishing them exposed
  is fixed.

### Fixed
- Documentation pinned v0.3.3 rather than the stale v0.3.2.

## [v0.3.3] — 2026-08-04

The release that made non-Go repositories auditable at all. The launch scheduled for
this day was called off when the first run against a real Node project showed it
could not be audited; this release is the answer to that.

### Fixed
- **A real Node/TypeScript project can now be audited at all** (#81), plus two
  further gaps found by actually running corral against a third-party TypeScript
  project.
- **The jail could not see any gem installed on Debian/Ubuntu** — Ruby audits failed
  environmentally, not substantively.
- **The cross-vendor router routes every role**, not just the critic.
- **The authored killing test is written in the *project's* harness**, not the
  plugin's (#85), and a failed authored test now says *which way* it failed (#85).
- A test command's argv survives the trip through `TestCmd` (#91).

### Added
- The brain ingests a cloned repo's `AGENTS.md` as advisory memory.
- `AGENTS.md` — the operating guide this repo never had.

### Changed
- The five-languages claim is replaced with the evidence behind it.

## [v0.3.2] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **`corral version` wrote to stderr**, so anything capturing stdout got nothing.
- An all-Gemini scan asked for a Claude key.
- Self-audit: provision the toolchains the audited suite needs; audit the corral
  actually checked out rather than whatever `@main` resolves to; never spend on a
  stranger's pull request.

### Added
- **The Action accepts several provider keys at once** (`gemini-key`,
  `anthropic-key`, `openai-key`), so the critic need not be turned off.
- The Action writes the verdict where someone will read it
  (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`) and bounds what a run costs (`top`).

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- **`corral version` said "dev" for everyone who installed it.**

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-08-02

The largest release so far: whole-repo auditing, the GitHub Action, the scan ledger,
and a long run of honesty fixes.

### Added
- **`certify --repo`** — fan an audit out over a whole repository, with ranked
  candidates, bounded spend, derived goals, and full accounting of what was *not*
  audited and why. `--dry-run --json` gives you that inventory for free, with no key
  and no money.
- **corral ships as a GitHub Action**, with diff-scoped audits, `--substrate`
  selection, per-role model flags, `--tests` (a source-to-test map for repos whose
  layout convention can't pair), and an opt-in `--min-kill-rate` merge gate.
- **`corral scans`** — the scan ledger was write-only until now.
- **A DuckDB ledger** of what each scan audited and rejected, plus the evidence
  behind `ProvenMissed` rather than only the count.
- **Opt-in parallel mutant scoring**, order-preserving (safe only on the jail
  substrate — see the flag's own documentation).
- **`--critic-model off`** for deliberately single-vendor runs.
- A coverage pre-flight that fails closed, and test-pairing against ordered
  per-language conventions.
- Signature extractors for Ruby, JavaScript and TypeScript.
- A foreign-repo enumeration sweep pinned in CI on every PR.

### Fixed
- **A surviving canary invalidates the report** — a suite that ignores the audited
  file is *ungradable*, not zero.
- **Stopped fabricating `ProvenMissed`** in repo-aware scoring, and stopped claiming
  pairing evidence for files that were never paired.
- A same-length mutant could reuse a stale `.pyc` and read as a survivor.
- The authored test is sited where the project actually collects it, and a positive
  control proves it ran.
- The workspace substrate is serialized (files share one checkout), and idle workers
  no longer eat the mutant budget.
- Action inputs are no longer interpolated directly into shell scripts.
- Extraction of Python class methods — most real Python was invisible to the scan.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- The cockpit UI: verbose per-agent audit console, a human gate on proposed tests,
  and views grounded in real DuckDB audit data.

### Fixed
- `COULD-NOT-GRADE` is reported when the jail baseline fails, instead of a
  fabricated score.
- The jail test command is shell-quoted (argv-safe), `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` is pinned
  in the offline jail, and Go dependencies are auto-vendored for `--repo-dir`.
- Corrective test-writer retries feed the compiler's own error back instead of
  blindly repeating.
